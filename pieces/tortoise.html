<h1>Tortoise's Impromptu</h1>
<h2>by Yuseok Seol</h2>
<p>
This piece was written in 2019 and premiered by Chase Fox at Indiana University.
</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Necessary Equipment</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
This piece does not have any signal processing, but it uses Max/MSP to trigger sound files. The patch is set to trigger from the spacebar, but it could easily be mapped to a MIDI pedal. The output requires eight speakers, which would require a more expensive audio interface than most of the pieces in this bibliography.
</p>
<p>
The setup for this piece is shown below.

<p>
The patch for this piece is shown in the screenshots section. The patch operator turns the audio system on by pressing the big button, and the spacebar advances the cues. There are also controls for selecting cues for rehearsal purposes.

<h2>Recordings</h2>
<p>
A recording of this piece can be found at <a href="https://cecm.indiana.edu/concerts/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a>. It was performed on the CECM Fall 2019 Concert starting at 00:37:45.
</p>
<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<p>
This piece features the upper range of the bassoon, ascending to high E. There are also some very quick rhythmic passages, as well as some extended techniques. These include air attacks, multiphonics, and flutter-tonguing. The electronics are not too difficult, although there are some passages with cues happening every measure. Overall, this piece is likely to be a challenge for most undergraduate students, but it would be possible for advanced students. 
</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>
This piece is more in the avant-garde style and features chromatic writing in the bassoon part and experimental electronic sounds. However, it would be more accessible to audiences than many of the other experimental bassoon pieces.
