<h1>Du Neant Qui Le Croit</h1>
<h2>by Miguel Azguime</h2>
<p>
This piece was written in 1994 and is published by <a href="https://www.babelscores.com/catalogs/instruments-electronics/du-neant-qui-le-croit" target="_blank">BabelScores</a>. It currently does not run in modern versions of Max/MSP. At last contact, the composer did not have time to update the patch to make it run again. Originally the piece was written with Eventide processors, and ported to Max/MSP in 2000.

<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Necessary Equipment</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<<p>Without a working patch, this piece is unplayable at the moment. But from screenshots sent by the composer, it seems the patch listens to the bassoon through two microphones, and has some sort of digital signal processing. There also seem to be clips of prerecorded music to play at different times, possibly controlled by a MIDI pedal that sends messages on controller 64.</p>
