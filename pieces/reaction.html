The patch for this piece is shown in the screenshot section. This patch requires a couple of extra packages to be installed in Max. The first is Auzzie, and the second is Mubu. Both can be obtained from Max/MSP's package manager. After launching the patch, the performer simply has to turn on the audio by pressing the sound icon near the top of the patch, then advancing the patch either by pressing the spacebar or by pressing the MIDI pedal.

<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<p>
This piece is not very difficult from a technical standpoint. The most difficult aspect is the range of the piece. While it ascends to the C above middle C, it is not rhythmically fast in the high register. There are some extended techniques&mdash;multiphonics, timbral trills, and helicopter tonguing&mdash;but they should be manageable by most undergraduate students. The electronics part similarly is not very difficult. The pedal cues are not spaced too close together. Overall, this piece would be a good piece for undergraduate students, provided they can play in the upper register of the instrument.
</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>
Despite the use of some extended techniques, this piece is very accessible and would fit in any recital program.
