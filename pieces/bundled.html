<h1>The Effect of Bundled Sticks on Sound</h1>
<h2>by Jeremy Mayall</h2>
<p>
This piece was composed by Jeremy Mayall in 2006 and can be obtained by contacting the composer at <a href="http://jeremymayall.com" target="_blank">his website</a>.
</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
This piece requires the use of many different effects: delay, wah, chorus, distortion, and a phaser. It is not hard to see why a robust multieffects unit would be preferable for this piece. Having another performer controlling the effects may also be beneficial, as is done in the recording below.
</p>
<p>
A setup diagram for this piece is shown below. Alterations to the order of these effects are certainly possible.

<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<p>
The technical aspects of this piece are not overly difficult, yet may be out of reach of many undergraduate students due to the extended techniques. These include key slaps, tonguing effects, and humming while playing. The electronics are more involved. There are pedal changes almost every phrase, and some of them have a quick transition of turning off one effect and turning another one on at the same time. Having a multieffects pedal with programmable presets may be an easier way to perform this piece than using separate stomp boxes. 
</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>
This piece is very free with many tempo changes. It is not very tonal, yet does not seem extremely experimental or avant-garde. It would likely be received well by audiences accustomed to contemporary avant-garde music.
