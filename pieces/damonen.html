<h1>Innere D&auml;monen (Entre Cisnes y Diablos)</h1>
<h2>by Jorge García del Valle Méndez</h2>
<p>
This piece was written in 1999 and no longer works as a Max/MSP patch. But it has endured as a fixed media piece. The Max/MSP patch worked with an Akai Sampler to trigger different sound samples. The piece can be obtained by contacting the composer at <a href="http://jorgegadelvalle.com" target="_blank">his website</a>.

<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<p>
From a technical standpoint, this piece has some difficulties but could be possible for an advanced undergraduate student. Much of the content is long sustained notes with big leaps between them. There are some glissandi and multiphonics as well. Without a functioning patch it is hard to determine how difficult the electronics are for this piece. For a performance with the fixed media, there is no click track, so staying in sync with the track may be difficult.
</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>
This piece is largely unaccompanied bassoon with ambient sounds. There are some moments where the electronics become more intrusive. The bassoon part features chromatic intervals and sounds almost like an early twentieth-century atonal piece with some electronic ambience.
