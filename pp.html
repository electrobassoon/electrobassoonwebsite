<h1>Performance Practice</h1>
<p>
  Performing live electroacoustic music presents the performer with many challenges that are unique to electroacoustic music. The most notable challenges are interacting with hardware and software that are likely new to the performer. In many cases, performers can work collaboratively with composers or recording engineers to help with these features, but performers will be better equipped to perform this music if they have some basic understanding of all the equipment and software being used. This also aids in what Enns calls the "self-sufficient approach"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> for electroacoustic music. Having a better understanding of the performance practice of live electroacoustic music allows a performer to have increased confidence in performance, rely less on sound technicians, and perform in more venues, and it allows the performer to teach other prospective performers how to perform this genre of music.

<p><a href="parts.html">Basic parts of interactive electroacoustic performance systems</a> discusses the input, processing, and output phases used in the performance of interactive electroacoustic music. While it focuses on the bassoon, the principles are applicable to other instruments as well.

<p>For a deeper dive into aspects of the performance system, there are also pages about <a href="mic.html">microphones</a>, <a href="gear.html">effects pedals and amps</a>, and <a href="software.html">software</a>. Other difficulties to consider are discussed on the <a href="observations.html">observations</a> page.</p>
