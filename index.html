<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome to <i>The Electric Bassoon</i>, which is a resource for bassoonists wanting to explore the rich field of interactive electroacoustic music for the bassoon. Interactivity in music can have many definitions, but for the purpose of this site this includes any music with electronics that requires more than just hitting play on a fixed media track (&ldquo;tape&rdquo; pieces).</p>
<p>Here you will find an in-depth resource on the majority of existing repertoire for the bassoon and interactive electronics. If you are interested in performing in this style, but don't know what equipment you need, a good starting place will be the <a href="pp.html">performance practice</a> page. Then, you can look at individual pieces for the specific needs of each piece on the <a href="bib.html">list of works</a> page. Also included are setup diagrams and brief comments about style.</p>
<p>If you are aware of a piece and don't see it here, please reach out to me on my <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page and let me know! I want this resource to be as exhaustive as possible!</p>
